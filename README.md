# HelloWorld
Default Github test 

I am brand new to coding & look forward to working with my fellow online Harvard cohort & tutors to accelerate my learning.
I am London, UK based & an avid soccer fan & love my dogs!
And look forward to graduating in time for end of December 2018!
Starting late but looking to put in the hours to graduate in time.
Thanks in advance for all your help! :)
